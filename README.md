Compatible with Quasar v2.

# Warning

For now, a Quasar app with Typescript support is required when using the app extension. This is due to the fact that there is currently no way to [render](https://quasar.dev/app-extensions/development-guide/install-api#api-render) the source files to a Javascript file. You can however rewrite the rendered files to JS by yourself.

# Structure

- [/ui](ui) - standalone npm package
- [/app-extension](app-extension) - Quasar app extension
