# v1 users

**v2 is not compatible with v1**

v2 is completely rewritten and is now backend agnostic and places the pages into your app. You have to add routes to the pages manually, e.g.:

```js
{ path: '/login', component: () => import('pages/auth/Login.vue') },
{ path: '/register', component: () => import('pages/auth/Register.vue') },
{ path: '/password/forgot', component: () => import('pages/auth/PasswordForgot.vue') },
{ path: '/password/reset', component: () => import('pages/auth/PasswordReset.vue') },
{ path: '/verification', component: () => import('pages/auth/Verification.vue') },
```

In addition, you have to change the authentication logic in `auth.ts` to communicate with your backend. You probably have to replace the promises with axios requests, but you could also use Apollo for example.

# Install

```bash
quasar ext add http-authentication
```

Quasar CLI will retrieve it from NPM and install the extension.

Upon installation you will have a `src/pages/auth` folder which contains all authentication pages. Do not forget to modify `auth.ts` to correctly communicate with your backend.

# Uninstall

```bash
quasar ext remove http-authentication
```

# Info

## Backend agnostic

This app extension now only provides the following components which you can use in your app in any way you want:
LoginComponent, ConsentComponent, RegisterComponent, PasswordResetComponent, PasswordForgotComponent

## Helper functions

`quasar-ui-http-authentication` exports multiple helper functions for getting/setting cookies and opening dialogs. See [helpers.ts](../ui/src/utils/helpers.ts).

If you use specific authentication logic and routes (e.g. for a specific framework) and want to share it with other users, you are welcome to submit a PR. At this moment no standard authentication logic is provided.
